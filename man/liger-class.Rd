\title{The LIGER Class}
\description{
The liger object is created from two or more single cell datasets. To construct a
liger object, the user needs to provide at least two expression (or another
single-cell modality) matrices. The class provides functions for data
preprocessing, integrative analysis, and visualization.
}
\details{
The key slots used in the liger object are described below.
