\title{The LIGER Class}
\description{
The liger object is created from two or more single cell datasets. To construct a
liger object, the user needs to provide at least two expression (or another
single-cell modality) matrices. The class provides functions for data
preprocessing, integrative analysis, and visualization.
}
\details{
The key slots used in the liger object are described below.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{raw.data}}{List of raw data matrices, one per experiment/dataset (genes by cells)}

\item{\code{norm.data}}{List of normalized matrices (genes by cells)}

\item{\code{scale.data}}{List of scaled matrices (cells by genes)}

\item{\code{cell.data}}{Dataframe of cell attributes across all datasets (nrows equal to total number
cells across all datasets)}

\item{\code{var.genes}}{Subset of informative genes shared across datasets to be used in matrix
factorization}

\item{\code{H}}{Cell loading factors (one matrix per dataset, dimensions cells by k)}

\item{\code{H.norm}}{Normalized cell loading factors (cells across all datasets combined into single
matrix)}

\item{\code{W}}{Shared gene loading factors (k by genes)}

\item{\code{V}}{Dataset-specific gene loading factors (one matrix per dataset, dimensions k by genes)}

\item{\code{tsne.coords}}{Matrix of 2D coordinates obtained from running t-SNE on H.norm or H matrices}

\item{\code{alignment.clusters}}{Initial joint cluster assignments from shared factor alignment}

\item{\code{clusters}}{Joint cluster assignments for cells}

\item{\code{snf}}{List of values associated with shared nearest factor matrix for use in clustering and
alignment (out.summary contains edge weight information between cell combinations)}
